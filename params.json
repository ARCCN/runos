{"name":"Runos","tagline":"Runos OpenFlow Controller","body":"### Introduction\r\n\r\n“_Could an OpenFlow controller be both easy to develop applications for and also high performance?_”\r\n\r\n*Runos* is an OpenFlow Controller. \r\n\r\nIt is fully userspace controller with high functionality, easy to develop your apps, relatively high performance comparing with existing controllers.\r\n\r\nIt supports OpenFlow 1.3.\r\n\r\nBasic characteristics:\r\n* Performance: 8M fps (flows per second)\r\n* Latency: 55 us\r\n\r\nCurrent list of applications:\r\n* L2 learning switch – on each switch individually, learning mac addresses.\r\n* Topology discovery\r\n* End host monitoring -- tracking the activity and presence in the network end nodes (roaming).\r\n* L2 forwarding – building the shortest path across the network.\r\n\r\nWe have a VirtualBox VM with pre-installed RUNOS: http://bit.ly/runos-vm-latest\r\n\r\nSlides with architecture details and roadmap are here: http://www.slideshare.net/AlexanderShalimov/runos-openflow-controller-eng\r\n","google":"UA-37225233-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
