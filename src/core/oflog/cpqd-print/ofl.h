 * For each feature the following functions must be provided:
 *
 * pack: given an experimenter structure, the function should return its
 *       OpenFlow wire format representation.
 * unpack: given the OpenFlow wire format representation of an experimenter
 *         structure, it should return the experimenter structure. The passed
 *         in len tells the available length of bytes in the wire format. The
 *         function should subtract the amount of bytes used up during the
 *         conversion.
 * free: passing an experimenter structure, this function must make sure the
 *       structure is freed.
 * ofp_len: passing an experimenter structure, the function must return the
 *          length of the OpenFlow wire format representation of the structure.
 * to_string: passing an experimenter structure, the function must return a
