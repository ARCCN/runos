   - Statistic service (web ui) - gathering stats from devices and send to the web interface.
   - Flow manager (web ui, rest api) - caching flows in the controller.
   - STP service for broadcast packets - calculating spaning tree for a network and pushing rules for broadcast packets. Note it doesn't work for disconnected network.
   - Pure cbench mode - just test packet_in/packet_out I/O. It's different from Cbench app that uses the entire TraceTree pipeline.
   - Manual how to run Runos with ha-linux setup to have a cold backup instance.
